# IntelliWatch
The AI-Driven Intelligent Surveillance System is an innovative solution designed to revolutionize security and surveillance operations. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, the system provides real-time monitoring, proactive threat detection, and automated decision-making capabilities.Key features include:

1. Real-time video analysis: Utilized advanced object detection algorithms to identify and track objects of interest, such as people, vehicle, metal objects and suspicios items.

2. Gesture detection: Easy identification of specific gestures or movements, such as stabbing, choking, drilling, and other suspicios activities enabling enhanced situational awareness and response.

3. Infrared detection: Incorporate infrared sensors to detect heat signatures and infrared radiation, enabling surveillance in low-light conditions or obscured environments.

4. Alert on wire cutting or switch-off: Trigger alerts in real-time when the system detects tampering or sabotage attempts, such as cutting wires or switching off cameras, ensuring rapid response and intervention by security personnel.

5. Intelligent alerting: Automatically generate alerts for suspicious behavior, unauthorized access, or security threats, facilitating rapid response and intervention by security personnel.

6. User-friendly interface: This project has an intuitive and user-friendly interface for security operators to easily access, monitor, and manage surveillance data and alerts, enhancing operational efficiency and effectiveness.
